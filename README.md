# Simultaneous Epoch Training Proof-of-Concept (SETPoC) 💻

Experience a new frontier in machine learning training with the SETPoC approach. This method involves training multiple epochs in parallel, potentially leading to faster convergence and improved model generalization.

## 🌟 Highlights

- **Parallel Training**: Harness the power of concurrent processing by training multiple epochs simultaneously.
- **Aggregation Strategy**: Intelligently combine the results from parallel epochs for robust model updates.
- **Enhanced Convergence**: Potential for models to converge to optimal solutions faster than traditional methods.
- **Proof-of-Concept**: Understand the foundational logic behind this approach and its potential applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone and Navigate**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd simultaneous-epoch-training-poc
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Execute the Proof-of-Concept**:
   ```bash
   python simultaneous_epoch_training.py
   ```

Note: Adjust hyperparameters or model configurations in the provided code as required to explore various scenarios!

## 📝 Approach Variants

The proof-of-concept showcases two primary variants of simultaneous epoch training:
- **Partitioned Data**: Model clones are trained on different segments of the training data.
- **Same Data**: Each model clone is trained on the entire training dataset.

## 🛠 Future Roadmap

🌐 Extend the simultaneous epoch training approach to more complex models and datasets.
🔍 Investigate integration with other training techniques for synergistic benefits.
📊 Develop metrics and visualization tools to monitor and compare the performance of different parallel training strategies.
